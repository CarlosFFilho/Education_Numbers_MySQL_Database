# Education_Numbers_MySQL_Database

Elaboration and feeding of relational database in MySQL containing world educational informations of 2014 (Data from Kaggle Dataset). Furthermore, the following graphic correlations were analyzed:

- Ratio Children enrolled in primary education (EPE) / Children out of school in primary education (OSP) for top 10 countries in terms of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). It is observed that, for the 10 countries with the highest GDP, Germany, Sweden and Switzerland present the best results, which may be a consequence of greater incentives for local education and the higher human development indices (HDI) of these countries;

- GDP versus Percentage of Repeaters in Primary Education (PRPE) to the top 10 countries with the highest GDP. It is observed that, even with fluctuations, there is a tendency for primary school students to repeat their school year due to a drop in GPD. For a better investigation, the level of charging for education offered in these countries must also be assessed, linked to their HDI;

- GDP versus Unemployment (UNEMP) to the top 10 countries with the highest GDP. It can be seen that, with the exception of Spain (Due to a strong economic crisis), there was an increase in the unemployment rate through a decrease in the value of GDP, which can be explained by the fact that there is a strong relationship between job offers and the GDP of a country;
